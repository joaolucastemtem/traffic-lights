Made by Jo√£o Lucas Temtem
Current version: 25/july/2020

This is an implementation of the game "Traffic Lights" or "Sem√°foro" in portuguese, using python and pygame.

Check the file main.py, which "applys" the functions that this file defines.

The parts of this program that lead with the user, such as the messages displayed in the console, are in portuguese. It is obvious that this should communicate with the user in portuguese since this was made to be used by students in Portugal.

This is not the final versio yet.
I've to make this code "clean" and I've commented, I've tried to follow PEP-8.
